Go Home


An employee can go home if:

they have finished the work planned for the day (variable workDone);
OR the workday has ended (variable dayFinished).
Write a program that checks whether the employee can go home (variable canGoHome).
Display the result in the console.

ðŸ’¡ To check if at least one condition is true, use the || (logical OR) operator.
